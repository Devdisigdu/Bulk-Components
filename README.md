# Bulk Components
Mod for Rimworld that adds recipes for crafting components and advanced components in bulk at a fabrication bench.

Crafting 10 at a time has a reduction in crafting time by aprox 75% per component.
Crafting 25 at a time has a reduction in crafting time by aprox 60% per component.

All recipes still cost the appropriate amount of steel per component, this is just for saving time when crafting large numbers of components at once.

Supports [ModManager](https://github.com/fluffy-mods/ModManager) version checking.
